	         RULES
The player (you) and the computer
will both get a card each.

You then get to guess if your card is
higher or lower than the computers.

If you guess correctly, you win!

If you choose to replay you will play
through the entire deck. Start a new game
at the start menu for a newly shuffled deck.
